## Assignment Overview

Now that we have all our content and it's starting to look more polished, we need to actually set up the layout of the documents so they're arranged as they are in the design team's prototype. We're going to use this assignment to tackle both the layout and the responsiveness of our site. We're close to being completely done!

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] `grid` and `flex` components are present to create the design team's layout <br />
 - [ ] The site is fully responsive regardless of screen size <br />
